# CinematicBuddyBlenderPlugin
 A WIP plugin to load Cinematics Buddy exports into Blender. Currently only imports ball and camera data and only works with 60 fixed FPS.

 Models are from the [CinematicsBuddyAssets](https://github.com/CinderBlocc/CinematicsBuddyAssets/tree/0b4b0dd54f42a30d39e3f32828ed53d6c09c0111)

 ## TODO
 - Parse car data
 - Accomodate for different FPS values
